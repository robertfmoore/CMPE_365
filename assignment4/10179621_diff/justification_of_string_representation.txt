The method i used to represent strings by integers is a polynomial rolling hash
function. I chose to do this because it is a robust way to compute a hash of a
string with a probability of collision close to 1/m since m is a prime. becaue
choice of m is fairly large (i.e. 10^9+7) this gives a very small probabiliity
of collision. because this modulo is small enough we can preform this hash
efficiently with only 64 bit integers. additionally this allows us to save the
value in a single integer regardless of how long the string is.
